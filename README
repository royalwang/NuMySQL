NuMySQL is a small portable wrapper for the MySQL C interface. 

	
REQUIREMENTS

NuMySQL requires Nu and nuke, the Nu build tool. To obtain
Nu, please visit http://programming.nu or get the source
from the Nu git repository on github:
	http://github.com/timburks/nu
	
NuMySQL requires mysql. Before building NuMySQL, please 
be sure that mysql is installed on your system. The
default build configuration expects mysql to be installed
in /usr/local/mysql.
	
The primary NuMySQL repository is on github:
	http://github.com/timburks/numysql

	
INSTALLATION

After installing all prerequisites, build the NuMySQL framework
by typing "nuke" in the top-level NuMySQL directory.
